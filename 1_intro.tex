\begin{itemize}
  \item If you use \begin{verbatim}\parencite{...}\end{verbatim} you will get just a reference, which may
    or may not contain names: \parencite{Qian2021}.
  \item If you use \begin{verbatim}\textcite{...}\end{verbatim} you will get the author names as well: \textcite{Qian2021}.
\end{itemize}

However, you could also cite \textcite{Sayama2020}, or \textcite{Bullock2023}.
