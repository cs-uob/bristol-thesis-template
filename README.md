# University of Bristol PhD thesis template

Constructed according to the regulations, which may be found at

  http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/pg/pgrcode/annex1/

The template is based around `xparse`, which we recommend all students learn, by
reading the [manual](https://ctan.org/pkg/xparse?lang=en).

The template also supports `latexmk` for compilation - just run

```
latexmk
```

to compile, and

```
latexmk -c
```

to clean the repository.

Finally, if you would like to use Unicode characters, `latexmk` can be
instructed to use `xelatex` by changing the relevant line of the `latexmkrc`
file:

```
$pdf_mode = 1; # pdflatex is 1, xelatex is 5
```
