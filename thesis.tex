\begin{abstract}

  % Abstract should be not more than 300 words, for either MSc or PhD.

  This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
  and main contributions (e.g. deliverables) and achievements; the same 
  section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
  reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
  topic, \emph{and} what your view of the outcome is.

  The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
  this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
  chapter. If your project is experimental in nature, this should include 
  a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
  for each project, but an example might be as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
    more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than 
    the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
    time.
  \end{quote}

  The latter aspects could be presented as a concise, factual bullet point list.
  Again the points will differ for each project, but might be as follows:

  \begin{quote}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the Java
      garbage-collection subsystem. 
    \item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux
      device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is used to
      control it.
    \item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping from
      A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
    \item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by
      \textcite{qian2021}, corrected a mistake in it, and compared the results
      with several alternatives.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{quote}
\end{abstract}
