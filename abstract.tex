% Abstract should be not more than 300 words, for either MSc or PhD.

This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
and main contributions (e.g. deliverables) and achievements; the same 
section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the 
reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this 
topic, \emph{and} what your view of the outcome is.

The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially 
this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first 
chapter. If your project is experimental in nature, this should include 
a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
for each project, but an example might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
  My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
  more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than 
  the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
  time.
\end{quote}

The latter aspects could be presented as a concise, factual bullet point list.
Again the points will differ for each project, but might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the Java
    garbage-collection subsystem. 
  \item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux
    device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is used to
    control it.
  \item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping from
    A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
  \item I implemented a version of the Dijkstra algorithm, corrected a mistake
    in it, and compared the results with several alternatives.
  \end{itemize}
\end{quote}
